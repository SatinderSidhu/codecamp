            <img src="Ride1.jpg" width="50%">
            <h3>Thunder Canyon was a pretty fun ride. I thought it was a little uncomfortable when the water</h3>
            <h3>was hitting hard on my head. It was basically that you go under different<h3>
            <h3>waterfalls. Although that it was really rough, I still would confidently say that it</h3>
            <h3>was my third favorite ride.</h3><br>
            <h2>2. Monster</h2>
            <img src="Ride2.jpg" width="50%">
            <h3>Monster was a really fun ride I did with Tegh. I loved the feeling in my stomach and the</h3>
            <h3>view from the top was splendid! The only thing I didn't like was that it was boring when 
            <h3>being stranded on the top and waiting for the other people to go off the ride. Even though
            <h3>that was boring, the view was beautiful, so I can say that it was my second favorite ride!!</h3><br>
            <h2>1. Thunder Creek Mountain</h2>
            <img src="Ride.JPG" width="50%">
            <h3>Thunder Creek Mountain was a blast!! To be serious, there wasn't even a single bad thing</h3>
            <h3>about this rideðŸ˜²! I really liked the drop at the end and water didn't get in my nose!</h3>
            <h3>At the end of this ride, I was speechless. I can proudly and without a doubt say that this</h3>
            <h3>was my #1 most FAVORITE ride at Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom!!</h3>
